            <p><span>Working with Beezwax was great. </span>Tara is a very talented engineer. We had a pretty tight budget and working with that in mind she was able to complete the bulky part of the project and give me enough assistance to see the job to completion myself. Because of the successful completion of this project we have saved at least 4 reams of paper in the last couple of weeks. Thanks for a great job and keeping our environment healthier!</p>

  description: Thoughtful software is the cornerstone of computing the beginning, not the end. Great software demands approachable, rewarding interfaces. Without them, people resist using computers This is a design failure, not a human one. Beezwax prizes visual clarity, but interface design isn’t purely aesthetic. It’s about grasping the interplay between people and the information they generate and consume. It’s about intuiting and promoting real users’ needs. Ultimately, it’s about improving the relationship between people and work.

We'll look for the gotchas, using our team's knowledge across FileMaker versions, as well as tools like InspectorPro to identify compatibility issues. Meanwhile, many new features are only potential  until you implement them. And, of course, we can help with that, too.

  description: Machine-to-machine communication for transferring file formats such as XML and JSON. In practice, the web service typically provides an object-oriented web based interface to a database server ( utilized by another web server, or by a mobile application ). Another common application may be a mashup, where a web server consumes several web services at different machines, and compiles the content into one user interface.

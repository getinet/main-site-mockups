    <p><strong>Introducing OfficeHub: </strong>an office and emergency manager that makes running your office a little smoother.</p>

    <p>Beezwax understood that this solution had to fit seamlessly into a person’s daily office flow and so we prototyped a native iOS app in Swift to run on an iPad at the front of our own office. We synced it to our FileMaker-based HR system’s employee database so it would have the current office roster, even without a full-time connection.</p>

Its companion FileMaker app helps you to quickly link OfficeHub to your staff database, and if you don’t have a staff database, then we can <a href="https://beezwax.net/services/filemaker">help</a>.  </p>

        <h4>Power of Swift and iOS</h4>
        <p>A native iOs app using Swift allows for a beautiful, pleasant, and seamless user experience. A native app would allow connection to other types of HR databases in the future, whereas a FileMaker Go app would allow connections to FileMaker systems. The flexibility to add features and to use all the features of the iPad and iPhone, like the camera, fingerprint readers, microphone, and geolocation were far greater with a native app as well.</p>

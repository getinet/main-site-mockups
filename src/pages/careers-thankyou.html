            <p>Beezwax develops custom solutions for interesting, innovative and fun clients who range from small non-profits to household name corporations. Every day we get to apply and develop our technical skills in multiple problem domains. Our team is largely based in the Bay Area, and partly geographically distributed; wherever we are, we support each other closely with pair programming (when desired) and strong and frequent communication. We have robust code review diligence that emphasizes testing, quality and smell-free code  — we have some very technical clients who demand this of us, which is our good luck.</p>
            <h4>position</h4>
            <p>We’re looking to add a senior Rails developer with strong communication and client skills, who can take on a leadership role both technically and as a mentor to others. You should be actively engaged and passionate about the technologies you are using, quick to learn, and excited to collaborate. The right person for this role is inspired by a work environment in which requirements and technologies vary from project to project, driven by a balance of the client’s needs and our expertise and experience.</p>
            <h4>requirements</h4>
            <ul class="bulleted">
              <li>Minimum 3, preferably 6 or more, years professional experience with Rails</li>
              <li>Thorough knowledge of Ruby on Rails and community standards code around structure and testing, with a commitment to writing well-tested code</li>
              <li>Communication skills that excel not only with other engineers of all levels, but also with project management and clients of all backgrounds and technical skill</li>
              <li>Expertise with technical leadership and mentorship</li>
              <li>Experience working as part of a distributed team</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>benefits</h4>
            <ul class="bulleted">
              <li>Competitive compensation, including a retirement plan and an excellent healthcare package with vision and dental</li>
              <li>Developer productivity and continued learning and professional development. We are active in the developer communities, both online and at events and conferences. We have continuous, vibrant in-house discussion on best practices and are constantly improving one another’s skillsets.</li>
              <li>Supportive, positive environment with first class project managers</li>
            </ul>

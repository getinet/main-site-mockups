    <h4>The Background</h4>
    <p class="lead">The Kaiser Permanente Educational Theatre of Northern California inspires children, teens, and adults K-12 to make informed decisions about their health and wellness through interactive plays and skits. This traveling troupe performs over 150 performances a year the theater troupe teaches children themes such as healthy eating, active living, conflict resolution, bullying, violence prevention, peer pressure, early adolescence, resiliency, healthy communication, stress, and social responsibility through contemporary music, humor, dance, and dialogue.</p>

    <p>To better reflect and connect to its young audience the theatre group often holds auditions to cast youthful performers/educators. To manage these auditions, callbacks, and interviews Kaiser asked Beezwax to update its FileMaker auditions database. It now allows actors to apply for auditions via the theatre group’s Wordpress web form, https://etnortherncalifornia.kaiserpermanente.org/general-auditions-for-performer-educator-position/. If an actor applied before, then the database matches a returning actor’s application to their historical profile based on actor’s submission email. The database uses that application to build an actor’s audition package: a 5-8 page PDF document made of their headshot, resume, video, and historical notes. The system then exports the audition packages to a share drive, organizing them by the year, month, and day of the appointments, so team members not within FileMaker can access and print them before each audition, callback, and interview.</p>

    <h4>The Beezwax Solution</h4>
    <p>The audition coordinator uses the database to schedule actors to time slots for auditions, then callbacks, and then interviews. The audition coordinator logs their assessment notes for each actor into an actor’s audition packet.</p>

    <h4>The Success Story</h4>
    <p>The database now fits better into the audition coordinators’ workflow, allowing them to consolidate the actor packets into appointments for each audition, callback, and interview. It also reduces the manual data entry the entire team had to perform to organize the audition packages into their respective auditions, callbacks, and interviews. The next steps will allow the application to email actors with their feedback and next appointment. We will also build a feature that will allow the audition coordinator to manage their auditions, callbacks, and interviews by using the application through their iPads.</p>

    <h4>The Beezwax Solution</h4>
    <p>To better reflect and connect to its audience, the theatre group often holds auditions to cast young performers/educators. To manage these auditions, callbacks, and interviews, Kaiser asked Beezwax to update their FileMaker auditions database. The system now allows actors to apply for auditions via a web form; if an actor applied in the past, the database matches their new application to their historical profile. The database then builds an actor’s audition package – a 5-8 page PDF including their headshot, resume, video, and historical notes – and exports it to a shared drive, so team members who don’t use FileMaker can access and print them before each audition, callback, and interview. The audition coordinators use the database to schedule actors for auditions, callbacks, and interviews, and also to log their assessment notes for each actor directly into the audition packet.</p>

    <h4>The Success Story</h4>
    <p>The database now fits better into the audition coordinators’ workflow, and eliminates a great deal of manual data entry that was previously needed to organize the audition packages. Upcoming enhancements will allow the audition coordinators to email actors with their feedback and next appointment, and to manage auditions, callbacks, and interviews by using the application through their iPads.</p>

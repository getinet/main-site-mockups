    <h2>Photos by Beez…</h2>
    <p class="lead">The original photography and artwork on our website has been created by Beez. This is a glimpse of who we are, and what we see. It's a small reflection of multiple talents on the teams of people who make up Beezwax. We’re proud of our Beez and how great they are to work with, and we look forward to working with you, too.</p>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>We're a talented team that truly enjoys working together. We created Beezwax collaboratively, as an environment where our work lives are fully engaging and satisfying.</p>

        <p>For as long as Beezwax has been around, we've supported a distributed workforce as an essential part of honoring each individual bee. This approach demands initiative and professionalism from everyone. The result is an effective team for whom work is a natural self-expression.</p>

        <p>We bring enthusiasm to our clients, with the hope of not just building great software, but helping build great workplaces as well.</p>

          not just financially
          Beyond competitive compensation and benefits, Beezwax supports individualized schedules and remote work. We work with clients and have responsibilities to them, but when not meeting with clients, Beez work at the times and places that are most effective for themselves. As for job security, in 20 years of business, Beezwax has not laid a single employee off.</p>

      <div class="small-12 columns">
        <h4>how do we do it?</h4>
        <p>At Beezwax, we fit our schedules to our needs, and unlike much of the industry, we pay hourly rather than salary. Many Beez choose to work a typical ~40 hour week. Others work closer to 20 or 30, and some regularly clock 60~80 hour weeks; your schedule is organized around your own situation.
        We believe hourly compensation is more fair, and benefits like PTO are prorated against a typical 40 hour week: eg a Bee who averages 80 hours/week earns twice as much PTO as a Bee averaging 40.

        We pay hourly not just to support individual and highly-flexible schedules, but also as a manifestation of our philosophical approach to work. At Beezwax, we work when we want to, and not when we don’t. We don’t show up and clock in and out; we make a conscious choice that “now, I’m working.”

        For a creative, effective, distributed team, this philosophy of intentional commitment is an important part of our work style and culture, as every Bee knows that every member of the team is fully engaged and present.</p>

            Family is an important part of a Bee’s life.  We love to share pictures of children
            and pets, bring our family to visit the office, and grow friendships with our fellow
            Beez. Work is just one aspect of our lives and we believe our time at work should
            make our lives better.
